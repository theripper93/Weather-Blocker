Block weather effects through drawings

## The module is no longer supported as of V10 Please use FX master instead.

Just create a drawing(Only Polygons and Rectangles are supported), in the drawing configuration enable weather blocking

If you have Bette Roofs installed, you can enable the "Weather Blocker Integration" in the Better Roofs settings to hide weather inside buildings. If levels is also enabled the weather will be blocked (or not) depending if you are under or on top of a roof

**Levels Integration**

If you use Levels as well, weather blocking drawings will respect the Top\Bottom set with Levels in the drawing configuration

**Inverted Mode**

You can enable the setting in the scene config, if enabled weather will be shown only inside the weather blocker polygons drawings
