Block weather effects through drawings

Just create a drawing(Only Polygons and Rectangles are supported), in the text field type "blockWeather" (no quotes)

If you have Bette Roofs installed, you can enable the "Weather Blocker Integration" in the Better Roofs settings to hide weather inside buildings

**Inverted Mode**

You can enable the setting in the scene config, if enabled weather will be shown only inside the weather blocker polygons drawings
